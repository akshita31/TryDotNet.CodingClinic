# Coding Clinic using TryDotNet

This repo is a quick play with [TryDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/try) to see how easy it would be to port the [Coding Clinic](https://coding.clinic) to TryDotNet.

## To run this

* Clone this repo.

* Install the global [dotnet try tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-try/):
  
  ```sh
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-try --version 1.0.19266.1
  ```

* Run DotNetTry:
  
  ```sh
  dotnet try
  ```

This will launch this document in your browser.

> This will only work using DotNetTry, clicking this link from GitHub will not give you a page that can run code.
